Welcome to Webgility Connect. To use these APIs, you must have a developer account with Webgility Connect. Visit our developer center to get started: https://developer.webgility.com/

Webgility Connect Platform enables applications and developers to seamlessly integrate with rich data in multiple accounting systems (QuickBooks and Xero) through Webgility Connect REST APIs.

Since our REST APIs are based on open standards, you can use any programming language to access them.

The Connect REST APIs provide access to resources (data entities) via URI paths. To use our REST APIs, your application will make HTTP requests and parse the responses. The Connect REST APIs use JSON as their communication format, and the standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.
